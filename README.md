# Chess Game Analysis

A comprehensive analysis of chess game patterns across different skill levels, comparing online games from Lichess.org with grandmaster matches and AI games. The main file is ms3.ipynb.

## Project Overview

This analysis examines three distinct chess datasets to understand how factors like player ratings influence game outcomes, length, and strategies. The project compares:
- Modern online games from Lichess.org
- Historical grandmaster games
- AI games generated by Stockfish

## Key Findings

- Player skill level strongly correlates with:
  - Game length (higher-rated games tend to be longer)
  - Victory conditions (higher-rated players resign more often vs. getting checkmated)
  - Draw frequency (increases with player rating)
  - Opening move selection (d4 and Nf3 become more common at higher ratings)

- White maintains advantage across skill levels:
  - 49.86% win rate for white
  - 45.40% win rate for black
  - 4.74% draw rate

- Opening preferences:
  - e4: 62.81% of games
  - d4: 22.54%
  - Nf3: 3.61%
  - c4: 3.57%

## Data Sources

- Lichess games dataset: [Kaggle - Chess Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/chess)
- Grandmaster games: [Kaggle - Top Players Chess Games](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/liury123/chess-game-from-12-top-players)
- AI games: Generated using Stockfish Python API

## Models

Implemented a K-Nearest Neighbors model to predict player ratings based on:
- Opening moves
- Game outcomes
- Opponent ratings
- Victory conditions

Model Performance:
- 69.9% accuracy within 100 rating points
- 85.2% accuracy within 200 rating points
- 92.7% accuracy within 300 rating points
- Median absolute error: 8.2 rating points

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Libraries: pandas, plotly, numpy, scipy.stats
- Stockfish Chess Engine API
